## Introduction

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the ability to think critically and logically is essential. The **Mind the Gap** project addresses the challenges associated with CoT tuning. By identifying and bridging gaps in thought processes, we enhance model performance. This repository contains the research and tools needed to implement these improvements.

## Project Overview

The project builds on the findings from our research paper, [Mind the Gap: Bridging Thought Leap for Improved CoT Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14684). Here, we present methodologies that allow for better CoT tuning, leading to more accurate and reliable AI outputs.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced CoT Tuning**: Improved methods for tuning Chain of Thought in AI models.
- **Research Insights**: Comprehensive analysis based on our findings.
- **User-Friendly Tools**: Easy-to-use scripts and tools for implementation.
